Recommended:

- The director of marketing (or the coder of marketing team) is the only one who can push to master while the other contributor should create a new branch.
- The Master coder then review the code and decides the cleanliness and the functionality of the code before being pushed to master
- This repository's master branch will automatically updates our current website, [uclguild.com] (http://uclguild.com/) as a result of modifying the CNAME and the Alias of the website itself.


Happy Coding xx
